# üç∏üçπ Cocktail Chat üçπüç∏

This project is a Python-based chat application that integrates with a large language model (LLM) to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a vector database. The application serves as a cocktail advisor, helping users with queries about cocktails and providing recommendations based on their preferences.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Queries**:
  - Find cocktails containing specific ingredients.
  - List non-alcoholic cocktails with specific characteristics.
  - Retrieve information about user-specified favorite ingredients.

- **Cocktail Advisor**:
  - Recommend cocktails based on user preferences.
  - Suggest cocktails similar to a specified cocktail.

- **Interactive Chat Interface**:
  - User-friendly chat interface using **Streamlit**.
  - FastAPI backend for robust and efficient API handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs).
- **OpenAI GPT**: Utilized for generating natural language responses.
- **FAISS**: Vector database for efficient similarity search and clustering.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: For generating dense vector embeddings of cocktail data.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend interface for user interaction.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for managing the API.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.

## Use Cases
